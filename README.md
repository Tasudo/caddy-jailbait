# caddy-jailbait

This is the first caddy extension by Tasudo([Minecodes](https://github.com/Minecodes)).<br/>
It's just a simple redirect to the Jailbait Sound (https://youtu.be/2okC8Sd4_C8).

Example:

```Caddyfile
jailbait.example.com

route {
    jailbait
}
```

Install:
```bash
xcaddy build --with github.com/Tasudo/caddy-jailbait
```
